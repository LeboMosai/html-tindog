# html-tindog

21 August

Part of my project within my current course with Udemy(Dr Angela Yi's : Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps)

I struggle with the Jumbotron section(Testimonies), aligning all the company logo/brands
I couldnt change the background gradient on the footer like the top half of the website (will revisit)
